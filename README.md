## About Me

I'm the co-founder and CTO of [Promptfoo](https://github.com/promptfoo/promptfoo), where we're building open-source tools to find and fix vulnerabilities in LLMs. We recently completed a seed round from a16z, and we're actively growing our team.

Previously, I was the VP of Engineering at [SmileID](https://www.usesmileid.com), where I led the development of ML-powered APIs for identity verification. During my time there, we scaled our platform to perform over 160 million verifications, helping millions gain access to essential financial services. Before SmileID, I co-founded and was the CTO of [Arthena](https://arthena.com) and also co-founded [Matroid](https://matroid.com).

With over 12 years of experience in software engineering and machine learning, I'm passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems.

## Current Projects
