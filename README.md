## About Me

I'm the co-founder and CTO of [Promptfoo](https://github.com/promptfoo/promptfoo), where we're building open-source tools to help organizations evaluate and secure their LLM applications. We're backed by a16z and are actively expanding our team to tackle the growing challenges in AI safety.

Previously, as VP of Engineering at [SmileID](https://www.usesmileid.com), I led the development of ML-powered identity verification APIs that processed over 180 million verifications, enabling financial inclusion across emerging markets. Before SmileId, I co-founded [Arthena](https://arthena.com) (as CTO) and [Matroid](https://matroid.com).

With 12+ years in software engineering and machine learning, I'm driven by the potential of technology to solve complex global challenges, particularly in AI safety and accessibility.
